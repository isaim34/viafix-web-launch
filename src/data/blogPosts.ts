      <p class="text-lg mb-4">Independent mechanics across Austin are discovering the advantages of working with ViaFix, the innovative gig-based auto repair platform that's transforming how vehicle services are delivered throughout Texas.</p>
      
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 mt-8">Flexible Work Opportunities</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">For ASE-certified mechanics looking to take control of their careers, ViaFix offers unprecedented scheduling flexibility. Unlike traditional auto repair shops with rigid hours, ViaFix mechanics can set their own availability, choose which jobs to accept, and work as much or as little as they want.</p>
      <p class="mb-4">This flexibility is particularly valuable for mechanics in Austin who want to:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
        <li class="mb-2">Earn supplemental income alongside existing employment</li>
        <li class="mb-2">Build their own independent business without overhead costs</li>
        <li class="mb-2">Create work-life balance that traditional employment doesn't offer</li>
        <li class="mb-2">Serve specific neighborhoods or areas within the greater Austin area</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 mt-8">Higher Earning Potential</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">Many mechanics report earning significantly more through ViaFix than at traditional repair shops in Austin. With our platform, mechanics:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
        <li class="mb-2">Set their own rates based on their expertise and certification level</li>
        <li class="mb-2">Keep a higher percentage of job costs compared to employment at chains</li>
        <li class="mb-2">Build a loyal customer base that provides consistent work</li>
        <li class="mb-2">Earn bonuses and higher visibility through our rating system</li>
      </ul>

      </ul>
      
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 mt-8">Direct Customer Connections</h2>
