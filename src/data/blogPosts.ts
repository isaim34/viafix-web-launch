Unlike traditional auto repair shops with rigid hours, ViaFix mechanics can set their own availability, choose which jobs to accept, and work as much or as little as they want.</p>
      <p class="mb-4">This flexibility is particularly valuable for mechanics in Austin who want to:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
        <li class="mb-2">Earn supplemental income alongside existing employment</li>
        <li class="mb-2">Build their own independent business without overhead costs</li>
        <li class="mb-2">Create work-life balance that traditional employment doesn't offer</li>

      <p class="text-lg mb-4">Austin's climate presents unique challenges for vehicle maintenance throughout the year. From scorching summers to occasional winter freezes, each season requires specific attention to keep your car running smoothly and efficiently.</p>
      
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 mt-8">Spring Maintenance (March-May)</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">Spring in Austin brings pollen, moderate temperatures, and occasional heavy rains. Focus on these maintenance items:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
        <li class="mb-2">Replace wiper blades that may have deteriorated during winter</li>
        <li class="mb-2">Check and clean air conditioning systems before summer heat arrives</li>

        <li class="mb-2">Replace cabin air filters to combat spring pollen</li>
        <li class="mb-2">Check for winter-related corrosion, especially if roads were treated with salt</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 mt-8">Summer Maintenance (June-September)</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">Austin's notorious summer heat requires extra attention to prevent breakdowns:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
        <li class="mb-2">Monitor cooling system integrity and coolant levels religiously</li>
        <li class="mb-2">Check battery condition - heat accelerates battery deterioration</li>
        <li class="mb-2">Ensure air conditioning is operating at peak efficiency</li>
        <li class="mb-2">Maintain proper tire inflation - heat increases tire pressure and risk of blowouts</li>
        <li class="mb-2">Consider higher viscosity motor oil appropriate for extreme heat</li>
