      <h1>Understanding Your Car Battery: Maintenance and Lifespan</h1>
      <p>Your car battery is a critical component of your vehicle, providing the necessary power to start the engine and run electrical systems. Here’s what you need to know about car battery maintenance and lifespan:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Regular Inspection:</strong> Check your battery terminals for corrosion and clean them as needed.</li>
        <li><strong>Proper Voltage:</strong> Ensure your battery maintains the correct voltage. A healthy battery should read around 12.6 volts or higher when the engine is off.</li>
        <li><strong>Avoid Draining:</strong> Don't leave headlights or accessories on when the engine is off, as this can drain the battery.</li>
        <li><strong>Lifespan:</strong> Car batteries typically last between 3 to 5 years, depending on usage, climate, and maintenance.</li>
        <li><strong>Warning Signs:</strong> Be aware of signs of a failing battery, such as slow engine cranking, dim headlights, and the battery warning light.</li>
      </ul>
